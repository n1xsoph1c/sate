## Introduction

The Pager project is a TypeScript-based utility for encoding and decoding text content into a structured format, allowing easy rendering of content in React applications. This documentation provides an overview of the project's structure and its core components.

## How to Use 

To use the Pager project in your own application, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. Then, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the Pager project as a dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install pager
   # or
   yarn add pager
   ```

2. **Import the Pager Class**: In your JavaScript or TypeScript file where you want to use the Pager project, import the `Pager` class:

   ```javascript
   import { Pager } from 'pager';
   ```

3. **Create an Instance**: Create an instance of the `Pager` class:

   ```javascript
   const pager = new Pager();
   ```

4. **Encoding Content**: To encode text content, use the `encode` method of the `Pager` instance. Pass the text content as a string:

   ```javascript
   const encodedData = pager.encode("Your text content goes here.");
   ```

   This will return a structured data format that can be used for rendering.

5. **Decoding Content**: To decode the structured data into React JSX elements, use the `decode` method of the `Pager` instance. Pass the encoded data:

   ```javascript
   const jsxElements = pager.decode(encodedData);
   ```

   You can now render the `jsxElements` in your React application.

6. **Rendering**: Render the JSX elements in your React component's render method or functional component:

   ```javascript
   function MyComponent() {
     return (
       <div>
         {jsxElements}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

That's it! You've successfully integrated and used the Pager project in your application to encode and decode structured content. You can customize the encoding and decoding logic based on your specific requirements.
