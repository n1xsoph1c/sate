## Introduction

The Pager project is a TypeScript-based utility for encoding and decoding text content into a structured format, allowing easy rendering of content in React applications. This documentation provides an overview of the project's structure and its core components.

```markdown
# Project Structure

The Pager project is organized into the following directory structure:
```
```text

pager/
├── core/
│   ├── decoder.tsx
│   ├── encoder.ts
│   ├── pager.ts
│   ├── types.ts
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
├── LICENSE
├── index.ts

```

- **core/**: This directory contains the core functionality of the Pager project. It includes the following files:
  - `decoder.tsx`: Contains the decoding logic to convert encoded data into JSX elements.
  - `encoder.ts`: Contains the encoding logic to transform text content into a structured format.
  - `pager.ts`: Defines the `Pager` class, acting as the central interface for encoding and decoding content.
  - `types.ts`: Contains TypeScript types and enums used throughout the project.

- **node_modules/**: This directory contains Node.js modules required for the project. These modules are specified in the `package.json` file and are typically installed using npm or yarn.

- **package.json**: This configuration file lists the Node.js packages and their versions used in the project. It also contains other project metadata.

- **postcss.config.js**: This file is the configuration for PostCSS, a CSS post-processor. It may include settings for processing and optimizing CSS.

- **tailwind.config.js**: This file is the configuration for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It defines styles, variants, and other Tailwind CSS settings.

- **README.md**: The documentation file you are currently reading. It provides an overview of the project's structure, its core components, and instructions on how to use the Pager project.

- **tsconfig.json**: The TypeScript configuration file for the project. It specifies TypeScript settings and compiler options.

- **LICENSE**: This file contains license information for the project, including the terms and conditions under which it can be used.

- **index.ts**: The entry point of the project, which may contain initialization code or exports for other parts of the project.

## How to Use the Pager Project

To use the Pager project in your own application, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. Then, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the Pager project as a dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install pager
   # or
   yarn add pager
   ```

2. **Import the Pager Class**: In your JavaScript or TypeScript file where you want to use the Pager project, import the `Pager` class:

   ```javascript
   import { Pager } from 'pager';
   ```

3. **Create an Instance**: Create an instance of the `Pager` class:

   ```javascript
   const pager = new Pager();
   ```

4. **Encoding Content**: To encode text content, use the `encode` method of the `Pager` instance. Pass the text content as a string:

   ```javascript
   const encodedData = pager.encode("Your text content goes here.");
   ```

   This will return a structured data format that can be used for rendering.

5. **Decoding Content**: To decode the structured data into React JSX elements, use the `decode` method of the `Pager` instance. Pass the encoded data:

   ```javascript
   const jsxElements = pager.decode(encodedData);
   ```

   You can now render the `jsxElements` in your React application.

6. **Rendering**: Render the JSX elements in your React component's render method or functional component:

   ```javascript
   function MyComponent() {
     return (
       <div>
         {jsxElements}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

That's it! You've successfully integrated and used the Pager project in your application to encode and decode structured content. You can customize the encoding and decoding logic based on your specific requirements.
